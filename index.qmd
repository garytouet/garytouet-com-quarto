## About me

I combine hands-on know-how and leadership experience in analytics and product development. In other words, I’m an analyst with product development experience or a product manager with strong analytical skills.

I can lead projects or teams to deliver work that moves the needle. I can also directly contribute thanks to years of experience as a product analyst:

- find patterns and insights in millions of records of customer behaviour data,
- prepare and visualise data using SQL, R or Python,
- launch, monitor and analyse a/b tests,
- equip teams with KPIs, dashboards and curated datasets.

I am comfortable working as a bridge between business leaders and technical teams. I can translate business questions into data problems and data insights back into business decisions.

The bulk of my experience deals with extracting insights from quantitative data sources. Nonetheless, I also have experience with qualitative data. I have carried-out small scale user interviews and usability tests for products I managed as well as survey analyses.

I acquired this breadth of skills mostly during my 8-year tenure at Zalando (European e-commerce scale-up). I got to grow alongside a company that was scaling from startup energy to enterprise sophistication. Most notably, I was part of the first cohort of product analysts in the company. I had the chance to work in teams at different stages of the product development process, always building the customer-facing web and app experiences. I ended writing documents that establish best practices for analytics during product development, I participated in the creation of the group’s data strategy and I later guided others into growing into these roles as a team lead.

Finally, I feel very comfortable in international environments. I find it easier to work in English than in my native French. I am also at-ease working in multidisciplinary teams (designers, engineers, product managers, etc.)

### Working with me

My approach is heavily influenced by Amazon's working backwards model: start with what you're trying to achieve, then figure out how to get there.

I bring a calm and organised approach to projects. I believe in finishing what we started first and in having transparent prioritisation mechanisms to keep things manageable. In addition, I approach ambiguity with serenity. Data combined with product management methods are great to reduce uncertainty and gain clarity.

I am open to feedback and I take it to heart to improve whenever given the chance.

I am used to cultures where we surface and discuss problems in an honest and dispassionate manner. I strive to leave my ego out of the equation and focus on what's best for the company.

Experience has taught me to be realistic about what data can and cannot do. I focus on insights that can actually influence decisions. I prefer to work in iterations. Incremental improvements beat grand plans that never ship.

I'm comfortable working in large corporate environments and understand how to navigate complex organizational structures effectively. Whether it's a fast-growing scale-up or a digital transformation initiative within a traditional company, I know how to work within existing processes while getting things done.

### What I can do for you
