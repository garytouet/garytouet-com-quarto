## Advantages of working with me

1. 10+ years of experience in data and analytics, with a track record of delivering impact in large corporate environments. I’ve worked with international companies in digital transformation like Henkel and Sodexo, and a pure-player scale-up like Zalando.
1. Proven ability to navigate complexity: I’ve mitigated risks in high-stakes product launches (millions of euros at risk), worked on cross-market features with millions of users, uncovered insights from terabytes of user behavior data.
1. Customer-focused and methodical: I bring battled-tested approaches developed during high-growth years at Zalando. I contributed to Zalando’s group data strategy and produced several documents who made their way into the company’s product development best practices.
1. Hands-on leadership: I can lead teams and projects, but I’m also happy to roll up my sleeves and execute when needed. I keep my coding skills fresh (SQL, Python, R) so I can automate and analyse on my own.
1. Solo freelancer: more affordable than consulting firms and we will build a more personal collaboration.
