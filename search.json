    "text": "About me\nI combine hands-on know-how and leadership experience in analytics and product development. In other words, I’m an analyst with product development experience or a product manager with strong analytical skills.\nI can lead projects or teams to deliver work that moves the needle. I can also directly contribute thanks to years of experience as a product analyst:\n\nfind patterns and insights in millions of records of customer behaviour data,\nprepare and visualise data using SQL, R or Python,\nlaunch, monitor and analyse a/b tests,\nequip teams with KPIs, dashboards and curated datasets.\n\nI am comfortable working as a bridge between business leaders and technical teams. I can translate business questions into data problems and data insights back into business decisions.\nThe bulk of my experience deals with extracting insights from quantitative data sources. Nonetheless, I also have experience with qualitative data. I have carried-out small scale user interviews and usability tests for products I managed as well as survey analyses.\nI acquired this breadth of skills mostly during my 8-year tenure at Zalando (European e-commerce scale-up). I got to grow alongside a company that was scaling from startup energy to enterprise sophistication. Most notably, I was part of the first cohort of product analysts in the company. I had the chance to work in teams at different stages of the product development process, always building the customer-facing web and app experiences. I ended writing documents that establish best practices for analytics during product development, I participated in the creation of the group’s data strategy and I later guided others into growing into these roles as a team lead.\nFinally, I feel very comfortable in international environments. I find it easier to work in English than in my native French. I am also at-ease working in multidisciplinary teams (designers, engineers, product managers, etc.)\n\nWorking with me\nMy approach is heavily influenced by Amazon’s working backwards model: start with what you’re trying to achieve, then figure out how to get there.\nI bring a calm and organised approach to projects. I believe in finishing what we started first and in having transparent prioritisation mechanisms to keep things manageable. In addition, I approach ambiguity with serenity. Data combined with product management methods are great to reduce uncertainty and gain clarity.\nI am open to feedback and I take it to heart to improve whenever given the chance.\nI am used to cultures where we surface and discuss problems in an honest and dispassionate manner. I strive to leave my ego out of the equation and focus on what’s best for the company.\nExperience has taught me to be realistic about what data can and cannot do. I focus on insights that can actually influence decisions. I prefer to work in iterations. Incremental improvements beat grand plans that never ship.\nI’m comfortable working in large corporate environments and understand how to navigate complex organizational structures effectively. Whether it’s a fast-growing scale-up or a digital transformation initiative within a traditional company, I know how to work within existing processes while getting things done.\n\n\nWhat I can do for you\nStrategic leadership:\n\nProduct management for your data projects\nLead or principal product analyst roles\nHelp develop analytics practices within your product organisation\nAccompany you in generating actionable insights from customer behaviour data\n\nHands-on support:\n\nExploratory data analysis and insight generation\nKPI definition and reporting frameworks\nA/B testing and experimentation programs\nETL, automation, and data pipeline work\n\nWhile most of my experience comes from e-commerce, I’m interested in working with all types of online services, websites, and apps. Good analytics principles translate across industries.\n\n\nContact\nWhether you’re looking for help with a specific project or just want to chat about analytics/product management, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn, Mastodon, or email."

    "section": "Saving in various sizes and formats",
    "text": "Saving in various sizes and formats\nThis is when things get more complicated for two reasons:\n\nNo clear spec for favicons exists. It depends on browsers, mobile OSes. Different formats, different sizes.\nResizing a plot is not as straightforward as I thought\n\n\nFavicon specs\nWhile browsing, I found various specs1 for this favicon. I will spare you the details. In the end, I landed on the following:\n\nfavicon.ico 32x32 (px)\nfavicon.png 96x96 (px)\napple-touch-icon.png 180x180 (px)\nfavicon.svg\n\n\n\nScaling issues\nSo far, I’ve set all my measurements in inches (figure size, font size). Now, my goal is to provide a size in pixels and to automatically resize and scale the icon accordingly.\nThe problem is…\n\nggsave(\n  p,\n  filename = \"icons/favicon_problem.png\",\n  dpi = 'retina', #retina = 320, according to documentation\n  width = 96,\n  height = 96,\n  units = 'px',\n  bg = \"transparent\"\n)\n\n\n… that the dimensions are good, but the proportions are not. With ggsave I can easily define the size in pixels, but this doesn’t change the font size in the plot.\nChristophe Nicault’s article Understanding text size and resolution in ggplot2 explains very well what happens. They recommend to use a package called ragg and the scaling option.\nI tried, but simply installing ragg created a big error2 in Quarto and completely destroyed my ability to preview my post. I also played around with the scale option in ggsave(), to no avail.\nAs a result, I decided to handle the scaling myself.\n\n\nDIY scaling\nSince I’ve defined sizes in inches when creating the graphic and since I want to express icon dimensions in pixels, I need to understand the relationship between inches and pixels first.\nFrom Understanding text size and resolution in ggplot2:\n\nThe relation is : (size in inches) = (screen size in pixel) / PPI or (screen size in pixel) = DPI * (size in inches)\n\nIn other words, if I want an icon with size 32 x 32 pixels, the conversion in inches will be 32 / 320 = 0.1 (with a resolution of 320). I can create a function that takes these two parameters as arguments, converts that to a measurement in inches and then passes that to ggplot2.\n\n# Function that creates the icon with sizes in inches\ncreate_icon &lt;- function(square_size_inches) {\n  p &lt;- ggplot() +\n    geom_tile(\n      aes(\n        x = 0,\n        y = 0,\n        width = square_size_inches,\n        height = square_size_inches\n      ),\n      fill = my_blue\n    ) +\n    geom_text(\n      aes(\n        x = 0,\n        y = -square_size_inches / 5,\n        label = \"G\",\n        family = \"Inter\",\n        fontface = \"bold\"\n      ),\n      color = \"white\",\n      size = square_size_inches /2,\n      size.unit = 'in'\n    ) +\n    theme_void() +\n    theme(\n      plot.background = element_rect(fill=\"transparent\", colour = NA),\n      panel.background = element_rect(fill=\"transparent\", colour = NA)\n    )\n\n    return(p)\n  }\n\n# Function that uses a size in pixels and a dpi to convert it into inches, create the icon and save it to disk\ncreate_and_save_icon &lt;- function(filename, size_pixels, dpi = 320) {\n  square_size_inches &lt;- size_pixels / dpi\n  icon &lt;- create_icon(square_size_inches)\n\n  ggsave(\n    plot = icon,\n    filename = filename,\n    dpi = dpi,\n    width = size_pixels,\n    height = size_pixels,\n    units = 'px',\n    bg = \"transparent\"\n  )\n}\n\nLet’s try it out!\n\ncreate_and_save_icon(filename = 'icons/favicon_32x32.png', size_pixels = 32, dpi = 320)\n\n\nIt works! I can now generate the different sizes that I need.\n\nsizes = c(32, 96, 180)\n\nfor (size in sizes) {\n  filename = paste0('icons/favicon_', size, 'x', size, '.png')\n\n  create_and_save_icon(filename = filename, size_pixels = size, dpi = 320)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfavicon_32x32.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfavicon_96x96.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfavicon_180x180.png\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for the last one, the .svg version. Here, we’ll use the base R built-in SVG graphics device:\n\nicon &lt;- create_icon(1)\nsvg(\"icons/favicon.svg\", width = 1, height = 1)\nprint(icon)\ninvisible(dev.off())\n\n\n\n\nfavicon.svg"
