It was refreshing to read.\nThese days, I spend more time than usual on LinkedIn and I follow the Tech news more consistently. I often question my own judgment and my own sanity while reading.\nThe amount of blind embrace for this technology in the mainstream’s discourse is astounding in my opinion. I’m looking forward to the next stage of the hype cycle, when reality sets in and expectations lower, to have more interesting discussions."

    "text": "Saving in various sizes and formats\nThis is when things get more complicated for two reasons:\n\nNo clear spec for favicons exists. It depends on browsers, mobile OSes. Different formats, different sizes.\nResizing a plot is not as straightforward as I thought\n\n\nFavicon specs\nWhile browsing, I found various specs1 for this favicon. I will spare you the details. In the end, I landed on the following:\n\nfavicon.ico 32x32 (px)\nfavicon.png 96x96 (px)\napple-touch-icon.png 180x180 (px)\nfavicon.svg\n\n\n\nScaling issues\nSo far, I’ve set all my measurements in inches (figure size, font size). Now, my goal is to provide a size in pixels and to automatically resize and scale the icon accordingly.\nThe problem is…\n\nggsave(\n  p,\n  filename = \"icons/favicon_problem.png\",\n  dpi = 'retina', #retina = 320, according to documentation\n  width = 96,\n  height = 96,\n  units = 'px'\n)\n\n\n… that the dimensions are good, but the proportions are not. With ggsave I can easily define the size in pixels, but this doesn’t change the font size in the plot.\nChristophe Nicault’s article Understanding text size and resolution in ggplot2 explains very well what happens. They recommend to use a package called ragg and the scaling option.\nI tried, but simply installing ragg created a big error2 in Quarto and completely destroyed my ability to preview my post. I also played around with the scale option in ggsave(), to no avail.\nAs a result, I decided to handle the scaling myself.\n\n\nDIY scaling\nSince I’ve defined sizes in inches when creating the graphic and since I want to express icon dimensions in pixels, I need to understand the relationship between inches and pixels first.\nFrom Understanding text size and resolution in ggplot2:\n\nThe relation is : (size in inches) = (screen size in pixel) / PPI or (screen size in pixel) = DPI * (size in inches)\n\nIn other words, if I want an icon with size 32 x 32 pixels, the conversion in inches will be 32 / 320 = 0.1 (with a resolution of 320). I can create a function that takes these two parameters as arguments, converts that to a measurement in inches and then passes that to ggplot2.\n\n# Function that creates the icon with sizes in inches\ncreate_icon &lt;- function(square_size_inches) {\n  p &lt;- ggplot() +\n    geom_tile(\n      aes(\n        x = 0,\n        y = 0,\n        width = square_size_inches,\n        height = square_size_inches\n      ),\n      fill = my_blue\n    ) +\n    geom_text(\n      aes(\n        x = 0,\n        y = -square_size_inches / 5,\n        label = \"GT\",\n        family = \"Inter\",\n        fontface = \"bold\"\n      ),\n      color = \"white\",\n      size = square_size_inches /2,\n      size.unit = 'in'\n    ) +\n    theme_void()\n\n    return(p)\n  }\n\n# Function that uses a size in pixels and a dpi to convert it into inches, create the icon and save it to disk\ncreate_and_save_icon &lt;- function(filename, size_pixels, dpi = 320) {\n  square_size_inches &lt;- size_pixels / dpi\n  icon &lt;- create_icon(square_size_inches)\n\n  ggsave(\n    plot = icon,\n    filename = filename,\n    dpi = dpi,\n    width = size_pixels,\n    height = size_pixels,\n    units = 'px',\n    bg = my_blue #otherwise white outline in png\n  )\n}\n\nLet’s try it out!\n\ncreate_and_save_icon(filename = 'icons/favicon_32x32.png', size_pixels = 32, dpi = 320)\n\n\nIt works! I can now generate the different sizes that I need.\n\nsizes = c(32, 96, 180)\n\nfor (size in sizes) {\n  filename = paste0('icons/favicon_', size, 'x', size, '.png')\n\n  create_and_save_icon(filename = filename, size_pixels = size, dpi = 320)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfavicon_32x32.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfavicon_96x96.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfavicon_180x180.png\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for the last one, the .svg version. Here, we’ll use the base R built-in SVG graphics device:\n\nicon &lt;- create_icon(1)\nsvg(\"icons/favicon.svg\", width = 1, height = 1)\nprint(icon)\ninvisible(dev.off())\n\n\n\n\nfavicon.svg"

    "text": "Most salient sections/concepts for me\n\nThe four key decisions when designing a dimensional model\n1. Select the business process\nThe advice is: start by modeling a business process. KPIs, metrics, reports can then be built on this fondation. Do not design your dimensional model based on the KPIs and reports available.\nExcerpt from the book:\n\nBusiness processes are the operational activities performed by your organization, such as taking an order, processing an insurance claim, registering students for a class, or snapshotting every account each month.\n\n2. Declare the grain\nThe grain defines the level of detail for the dataset i.e. what a single fact table row represents.\nChoose the lowest possible grain (atomic grain) from the source systems. This approach offers the most flexibility. Users can then aggregate and manipulate the data as they wish.\n3. Identify the dimensions\nDimensions provide the context for a business process event. For example, when a sale happens, the context dimensions are date, product, store, payment method, promotion.\nIn reports, dimensions serve as descriptive attributes (typically text labels). They are also used to filter the facts and to form groups during aggregation.\n4. Identify the facts\nFacts are the numeric measurements tied to a business event. All facts for a single event are stored in one table, which includes foreign keys. These keys link each fact row to its associated dimensions (the context information).\nFrom the book:\n\nFacts are the measurements that result from a business process event and are almost always numeric. A single fact table row has a one-to-one relationship to a measurement event as described by the fact table’s grain. Thus a fact table corresponds to a physical observable event, and not to the demands of a particular report. Within a fact table, only facts consistent with the declared grain are allowed. For example, in a retail sales transaction, the quantity of a product sold and its extended price are good facts, whereas the store manager’s salary is disallowed.\n\n\n\nBusiness participation\nThe authors emphasise that strong business buy-in is essential for project success. This makes sense, but two points stood out to me. They were not obvious at first and I found them particularly valuable:\n\nStaff the project with business team members, who are also responsible for its success. Give them responsibilities and ask them to gather requirements, feedback, validate certain decisions and spread the word in the organisation.\nEstablish a data stewardship/governance program beforehand, with identifiable data stewards. As the book states:\n\nData stewardship or governance programs should focus first on the major dimensions. Depending on the industry, the list might include date, customer, product, employee, facility, provider, student, faculty, account, and so on. Thinking about the central nouns used to describe the business translates into a list of data governance efforts to be led by subject matter experts from the business community. Establishing data governance responsibilities for these nouns is the key to eventually deploying dimensions that deliver consistency and address the business’s needs for analytic filtering, grouping, and labeling. Robust dimensions translate into robust DW/BI systems.\n\n\n\n\nThe three fundamental types of fact tables\n\nTransaction fact tables: these are the most common in my experience. Each row represents a single measurement at a specific time and place. It can be an event or one line item inside an event. Rows only exist if an activity occurred. The word transaction is confusing here, because it suggests a table with sales data. In practice, they are not limited to measuring sales.\nPeriodic snapshot fact tables: these tables summarise measurement events over a fixed period (a day, week, month, …). The grain is determined by the period selected. Unlike transaction tables, rows exist even if no activity took place. For example, I have used these to analyse the daily availability of inventory. A daily snapshot for each product and country was created with its availability status and its quantity.\nAccumulating snapshot fact tables: these tables represent the advancement of processes that have a clear start, standard intermediate steps and a clear end. Each row updates whenever the process reaches a new step, recording the data and relevant measurements. This structure simplifies calculating the time duration between various steps.\nIllustration from the book:\n\n\n\n\nVariations and adaptations of these fact tables:\n\nFactless fact tables\nAggregate fact tables or OLAP cubes\nConsolidated fact tables\n\n\n\nSCDs: Slowly Changing Dimensions\nDescribing these techniques succinctly is challenging. My notes below will make sense if you’ve read the chapters. Otherwise, the explanations may seem abstract.\nThis section taught me the most about dimensional design, associated trade-offs and opened my mind to technical complexity. I’ll admit: some SCD types took me multiple attempts to grasp. The book’s case studies were helpful for clarifying these concepts.\nThese techniques address a fundamental challenge: how to manage attribute changes in dimensions over time. For example, let’s imagine that a company updates its product categorisation system. A product previously in Sports is now in Streetwear. How should the dimension table reflect this change?\nFive core types:\n\nType 0: retain the original\n\nconsequence: facts can only be associated with the attribute’s original value\n\nType 1: overwrite\n\nconsequence: facts can only be associated with the attribute’s current value\n\nType 2: add new row\n\nintroduce a new surrogate key\nintroduce “row effective date” and “row expiration date” columns\noptional: add a “current row indicator” column\nconsequence: facts are associated with the attribute’s value in effect when the fact happened\n\nType 3: add new attribute\n\nreplace current attribute value in the target column\nadd a new column: “prior {attribute name}” which stores the attribute value\nconsequence: facts can be associated with the current and prior attribute value\n\nType 4: add mini-dimension\n\nuseful for large dimension tables (lots of rows) where Type 2 changes are frequent (which adds many rows)\nmove frequently changing attributes to a separate dimension (seems to be frequent for customer demographics dimensions). Leave stable attributes in the original table.\ncreate one row in the mini-dimension for each combination of attribute values. Alternatively, add rows only for existing combinations and update as new ones appear.\nconsider creating value bands for continuous attributes (convert salary to salary bands, for example)\nfinally, insert a foreign key to the mini-dimension in the fact table. It captures a snapshot of the combination of attributes (for example: the customer demographics profile) at transaction time.\n\n\n3 hybrid types:\n\nType 5: mini-dimension and type 1 outrigger\n\nthis builds on Type 4 by adding a foreign key to the mini-dimension in the large dimension table (outrigger)\nexample: in a large customer dimension with a mini-dimension for demographic attributes, each time the demographic profile is updated the foreign key in the customer dimension gets updated (Type 1 change)\nthe fact table provides the demographic profile at transaction time, while the customer dimension reflects the current profile\n\nType 6: add Type 1 attributes to Type 2 dimension\n\nnote: the name is confusing. It feels like a more advanced Type 3 SCD to me\nExample: with two columns, “historic department name” and “current department name” (similar to a Type 3 setup)\nwhen the department name changes:\n\napply Type 2: create a new row with “row effective date”, “row expiration date” and “current row indicator” columns with the correct dates/timestamps\napply Type 1: update the “current department name” value\n\nfacts join with the row active at transaction time, which also include the current attribute value\n\nType 7: dual Type 1 and Type 2 dimensions\n\nthe fact table includes two foreign keys:\n\none links to a dimension table managed according to Type 6\none links to a view of this dimension table showing only current values\n\nBenefit: when the fact table is queried, a choice is available. Use the historical values to filter and group by, or use the latest status\n\n\n\n\nCase study on Clickstream data\nMost of my analyst experience is in e-commerce, where Google Analytics clickstream data was the primary data source.\nI was curious to see how the authors recommended integrating this data into the data warehouse, for the following reasons:\n\nGoogle Analytics’ raw data, once exported to BigQuery, is heavily nested, with a schema that takes time to master. Expecting analysts from other parts of the company or other disciplines to use is not realistic. The learning curve is too steep\nAt Zalando, clickstream data resided outside the data warehouse in a separate system (BigQuery). Joining it with the data warehouse was costly due to time-consuming data transfers.\n\nThe authors outline a solution in their case study, using these building blocks:\n\nNew dimensions: Page, Event, Session, Referrer. I’d also include User\nTwo fact tables: one at the Session grain and one at the Page grain. The Page fact table is a novel idea for me. In theory, it could track event counts per page or measurements like loading times. In practice, it would be challenging to maintain due to frequent changes in web and app experiences\nAggregate clickstream fact tables: create tables at different grains (session, month, entry page, etc.) to summarise facts\n\nFrom experience, aggregate fact tables strike me as the most practical and valuable approach. This makes for much smaller tables to query (raw clickstream data is very large). Key user behaviour facts become easily accessible. And these tables can be intelligently augmented with new attributes (for example: a flag for sessions with cart abandonment, likelihood score of being a bot).\n\n\nAudit dimensions and error event schema\nI wish I had these for debugging in the past or to investigate sudden changes in metrics.\nI saw audit dimensions in action in a previous freelance project. For example, it let us trace suspicious numbers back to the exact ingested file. It allowed us to answer questions from business stakeholders with precision. Excerpt from the book with more details:\n\nWhen a fact table row is created in the ETL back room, it is helpful to create an audit dimension containing the ETL processing metadata known at the time. A simple audit dimension row could contain one or more basic indicators of data quality, perhaps derived from examining an error event schema that records data quality violations encountered while processing the data. Other useful audit dimension attributes could include environment variables describing the versions of ETL code used to create the fact rows or the ETL process execution time stamps. These environment variables are especially useful for compliance and auditing purposes because they enable BI tools to drill down to determine which rows were created with what versions of the ETL software.\n\nError datasets:\n\nThe error event schema is a centralized dimensional schema whose purpose is to record every error event thrown by a quality screen anywhere in the ETL pipeline.\n\nI have never encountered such error tables. But, as a data warehouse user, I would appreciate this transparency.\n\n\nConformed dimensions\nFrom the book:\n\nDimension tables conform when attributes in separate dimension tables have the same column names and domain contents. Information from separate fact tables can be combined in a single report by using conformed dimension attributes that are associated with each fact table.\n[…]\nConformed dimensions, defined once in collaboration with the business’s data governance representatives, are reused across fact tables; they deliver both analytic consistency and reduced future development costs because the wheel is not repeatedly re-created.\n[…]\nWithout shared, conformed dimensions, a dimensional model becomes a standalone application. Isolated stovepipe data sets that cannot be tied together are the bane of the DW/BI movement as they perpetuate incompatible views of the enterprise. If you have any hope of building a robust and integrated DW/BI environment, you must commit to the enterprise bus architecture. When dimensional models have been designed with conformed dimensions, they can be readily combined and used together.\n\nConformed dimensions are a clear advantage of dimensional models and are essential to their success. However, the effort required to achieve this conformity is easy to underestimate. Agreeing across departments on consistant names, values and definitions for business concepts is challenging. This is especially true when systems have evolved organically in different parts of the organisation or come from multiple vendors."

    "text": "Reflections\n\nData as a Product\nThe book does not describe it in these terms. However, it is clear that the authors advocate for the application of the product management method to the design of the data warehouse. They suggest a close relationship with the end users, understanding their needs and designing the dimensional model in accordance. They urge readers to consider the value to the business when making decisions. In many of their design guidelines, they emphasise ease of use for business teams. They recommend design solutions that engineers might view as suboptimal or overly complex in service of user experience. This is obviously how it should be.\nIt made me think of a principle that a former employer added to their group data strategy: “data as a product”. The goal was to change the company’s thinking on this subject. This principle especially targeted data-producing teams, encouraging them to treat data as part of their product surface area. One-sided schema changes, poor documentation, unreported incidents, data-quality all impacted downstream users (analysts, data scientists, consumers of internal reports). These problems slowed us down.\nI believe this was the right approach, and I was pleased to see the book echo this idea.\n\n\nVocabulary\nI had never encountered the terms used in this book to describe tables, techniques, columns, etc. I knew about fact tables and dimension tables. However, I had never heard of outrigger dimensions, didn’t know that fact tables had different names like accumulating snapshot fact table. When I saw the word grain, I immediately understood what it described, but I don’t think I ever heard this term. I definitely used the word level myself (at the user level, at the hit level) and I had discussions where granularity came up.\nIn a past project, without being aware of it at the time, I asked our central data engineering teams to improve an outrigger dimension for product certificates. I asked for the slow-changing dimension to go from Type 1 overwrite to Type 2 add new row. But we never discussed the change in those terms. We talked about “making the historical relationship between products and certificates available for analysis”. We wanted to historicise the table. This word was difficult to pronounce correctly in meetings.\nWhy didn’t we use this vocabulary?\n\nCould these terms be confined to data engineering circles and left behind when other disciplines are involved?\nAre these words in books, but rarely found in the field?\nThis is a book written by authors from the USA and my work experience is in Germany and France with lots of native and non-native english speakers. Could it be the reason?\n\n\n\nUser experience improvements\nAs a long-time user, I was very happy to read the following advice. The points will improve your end users’ life and save them from making mistakes:\n\nProvide human-understandable labels in addition to the technical codes and abbreviations. Quoting from the book:\n\nCryptic abbreviations, true/false flags, and operational indicators should be supplemented in dimension tables with full text words that have meaning when independently viewed. Operational codes with embedded meaning within the code value should be broken down with each part of the code expanded into its own separate descriptive dimension attribute.\n\nSimilarly, the book describes three different ways to handle Null values that make a ton of sense:\n\nIn dimension tables, the authors recommend substituting Unknown or Not Applicable in place of the null value. This applies when a dimension row is incomplete or when some attributes don’t apply to all rows.\nForeign key columns should never include nulls. Otherwise, referential integrity is broken i.e. all fact rows should be associated with all the corresponding dimensions.\nIn fact tables, numeric measurements can be left null because calculations like sums and averages will correctly handle it. Replacing null with a 0 would bias the average, for example.\n\nProvide a Date dimension so that users can easily filter or group by date-related attributes. I like an easy way to access weekend vs. weekdays , the full name for days (Monday, Tuesday, …), months (January, February, …) or even quarters (2026 Q1, 2026 Q2, …) with a simple join. Even better if public holidays can be accessed or if dates important to the business can be retrieved. I have parsed and formatted dates countless times in SQL or Python, just to extract details like month names.\nFinally, in the last chapter of the book, the authors focus on the implications that big data has on data warehouses and ETL systems. While doing so, they write “Add value to data as soon as possible”:\n\nYou should apply filtering, cleansing, pruning, conforming, matching, joining, and diagnosing at the earliest touch points possible. […] Conforming takes the active step of placing highly administered enterprise attributes into major entities such as customer, product, and date. The existence of these conformed attributes allows high value joins to be made across separate application domains. A shorter name for this step is “integration!” Diagnosing allows many interesting attributes to be added to data, including special confidence tags and textual identifiers representing behavior clusters identified by a data mining professional.\n\nIn my experience, data science teams often extract data from the warehouse, create insights in silos, and rarely return those insights to the warehouse. As a result, teams often duplicate work in silos or get stuck because they cannot reproduce time-intensive research or advanced data science. I appreciate the idea of enriching data as early as possible, especially by integrating results from company-wide data mining activities."

So I gave the LLM a broad description of what I wanted to achieve. I didn’t recommend packages, or specific methods. I only described what I had and what I wanted to achieve very broadly.\nInitial prompt:\n\nI have a file “.m4a” which is a recording of my fridge at home. I want to analyse the sound inside of this file to identify each time the fridge’s compressor runs. The sound is very distinctive and I know that in this file there are two compressor runs which lasts very long times. What should I do in Python?\n\nI’ll cut the story short, it disappointed me for the task at hand:\n\nI spent a few hours re-prompting, giving more precise instructions, explicitly asking for things and I never managed to get to something useful. The script was producing code that worked. All the packages used were safe and well-known. It was “analysing” my audio file and producing good data visualisations, but it couldn’t identify the compressor runs properly.\nThe code produced was very slow to run. It took between 5 and 10 mins each time. This made debugging and iterating very slow.\nFinally, in a different session, I tried prompting Mistral on the web. I supposed that my configuration in VS Code might be faulty. At first, it gave me interesting results, but I still stumbled in the last mile and couldn’t get to something useful.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast analysis generated before I gave up. The dashed red line is supposed to be a threshold used for detection. However, it does not seem to matter since data below the threshold is highlighted as compressor run…"

I am not a paying subscriber so I am using Claude Sonnet 4.5 on the free tier.\nAnd… To my surprise, it worked in 7 iterations. 🥲\n\nThe very first script that it generated was much faster than the one from Codestral: less than ten seconds vs. several minutes before.\nIts first attempt produced a graph that didn’t show which sections of the audio were identified as compressor runs. After I asked for it, it produced code that generated this graph. It was very easy to go from there to a finished analysis.\n\n\n\nIt produced parameters that I could manually tune. It explained to me what these parameters were doing with example values to illustrate. For example:\n\nLower (e.g., 60): More sensitive, catches quieter compressor runs but may have false positives\nHigher (e.g., 80-90): Only catches louder/clearer runs, fewer false positives\n\nAfter my 7th iteration, I had this output (pretty clean!):\n\n\nTotal segments above threshold: 11\nSegments after filtering (≥900s): 2\nDetected 2 compressor run(s):\n\nRun 1: 18.07min - 49.33min (duration: 31.27min)\nRun 2: 132.93min - 164.40min (duration: 31.47min)\n\nTime between runs:\n\nBetween Run 1 and Run 2: 83.60min\n\n\n\nThe code generated by Claude was better because:\n\nThe detection method worked much better from the get-go. And the code generated ran fast from the start too.\nIt used parameters whose values were based on my audio file. For example, the detection threshold was the nth percentile of a metric computed on the audio data itself. Manually tuning this percentile threshold was intuitive too.\nIt even proactively handled an edge case: what if the recording stops before the end of a compressor run.\nI have the feeling that Claude was more responsive to my input and request for change too. Maybe this has to do with a difference in the length of the context windows (6 times longer for Claude Sonnet 4.5 vs. Codestral in my use case)2.\n\nIn any case, this provided me with good findings and lessons learned for future projects, especially if I want to persevere with Mistral."

    "text": "Posit is the company behind RStudio and many widely-used R packages (such as ggplot2, the tidyverse). They also develop tools for other languages like Python (including their new data science IDE called Positron, and plotnine, their port of ggplot2 to Python). In short, they create a lot of useful tools for the data science community.\nEvery year, they organise a conference, and they just released the recordings of this year’s talks on YouTube.\nHere are my recommended talks (in no particular order):\n\nHow I got unstuck with Python (Julia Silge, Posit)\nAs I mentioned in a previous post, I started learning Python after R and found some key differences between the two languages challenging. Finding the right tools was also challenging. Julia Silge highlights pyenv as a turning point for her and it was for me too.\nOn macOS, Python isn’t pre-installed. Instead, it comes with the Command Line Tools, which must be installed separately. This made me feel uncomfortable. I didn’t like messing with the system’s python version (installing and uninstalling libraries). Also, the version was quite old (2.x) when I set up my local environment. Then I discovered pyenv and the concept made sense : it’s possible to install separate Python versions and to create isolated virtual environments. That’s what I chose, and still use today. Though maybe not much longer.\nJulia Silge has moved to using uv. I have read so many good things about it. It is next on my list.\nFrom messy to meaningful data: LLM-powered classification in R (Dylan Pieper)\nThe talk covers more, but it served as a good introduction to the ellmer package for me: how to interact with LLMs and get structured output in R. I also enjoyed the rest of the talk, especially the speaker’s use of traditional ML models as benchmark against the LLM.\nPosit and the modern data stack: Using Posit, Snowflake, and Databricks (James Blair)\nHere, the title is a bit misleading. The talk focuses on something more exciting: a Positron feature called Positron Assistant, which provides LLM-assisted coding and data analysis.\nSo far, these assistants required data to be available locally, which is a very unlikely scenario when working with enterprise data sources (data volumes are too large, downloading data is a privacy and security no-go).\nIn the demo, James Blair shows how the assistant can work with the data available in Databricks or Snowflake. You need to set the connection up first and then it will work off of the table names, table schemas and a small sample of data. It then produces code that will run on the Databricks cluster for example.\nThis feels like a nice step forward. It looks like the integration required a collaboration between Posit, Databricks and Snowflake. I’m still unclear about what enterprises need to do to implement this, and what metadata must be provided if any. Nevertheless, it’s an interesting development. Of course, the performance of these LLMs in this scenario remains to be seen.\nExpanding Quarto’s Capabilities with Lua (Christophe Dervieux, Posit)\nI built my website using Quarto. During the process, I encountered limitations and came across mentions of Lua filters and Quarto extensions. I decided to explore these more advanced topics later. My main goal was simply to get the site online.\nChristophe Dervieux’s talk was a great introduction for me. While I’m not yet confident enough to develop with Lua filters, I now understand their role. It was helpful to see the pipeline that transforms .qmd documents into HTML, and where Lua filters come into play."

    "text": "Here, I link to the second post from Claus Wilke in his series “Python is not a great language for data science.”\nI have read various posts about the differences between R and Python over the years and the details are usually too obscure for me. The inner workings of these languages are dissected in a way that I cannot relate to.\nIn this case, I did relate to it. I can recommend the article to anyone in data science who has to evolve between R and Python. Claus described issues I’ve encountered without fully understanding them.\nThe points that caught my attention are:\n\nCall-by-reference semantics: the fact that calling a function on a data object will modify the object passed as argument, even when no assignment to a new variable is done.\nLack of built-in missing values: different data analysis libraries treat missing values differently and make assumptions which are not obvious\nLack of non-standard evaluation: mutate() and arrange()in the tidyverse make common data science tasks so much easier to do and read. The syntax is cleaner too.\n\nFinally, don’t get me wrong, I am not ditching Python at all. I enjoy using it. It’s good to put words on frustrations and misunderstandings I’ve had in the past.\n\nIn addition, in Claus’ first post from the series, another topic hit close to home:\n\nSo here is a typical experience I commonly have with students who use Python. A student comes to my office and shows me some result. I say “This is great, but could you quickly plot the data in this other way?” or “Could you quickly calculate this quantity I just made up and let me know what it looks like when you plot it?” or similar. Usually, the request I make is for something that I know I could do in R in just a few minutes. Examples include converting boxplots into violins or vice versa, turning a line plot into a heatmap, plotting a density estimate instead of a histogram, performing a computation on ranked data values instead of raw data values, and so on. Without fail, from the students that use Python, the response is: “This will take me a bit. Let me sit down at my desk and figure it out and then I’ll be back.” Now let me be absolutely clear: These are strong students. The issue is not that my students don’t know their tools. It very much seems to me to be a problem of the tools themselves. They appear to be sufficiently cumbersome or confusing that requests that I think should be trivial frequently are not.\n\nThis happened to me too. At first, I thought the problem was coming from me. I am used to R’s ggplot2 library for data visualisation and I felt really slow in Python.\nIn a footnote, Claus Wilke notes that students who use plotnine do not have this problem. This matches with my own experience. Plotnine is a port of ggplot2 in Python. And it is now my first choice.\nAt first, I tried to learn matplotlib and I quickly realised that this was a no-go for me (simple plots were hard to build, commands hard to remember for me). Then, I saw many people recommend seaborn, which is based on matplotlib. It is better and more intuitive for me, but I still find working with it to be hard. I struggle especially when it comes to facets.\nLet’s say you plot aggregated data over several countries. And you want to see if there are differences between countries. In ggplot2, you don’t need to change much in your current code. One line of code allows you to facet by the dimension country and it’s easy to facet by two dimensions if needed.\nIn seaborn, some plotting functions support something similar, but not all of them do, which complicates things. Otherwise, you need to create a FacetGrid object, which is a slightly different way of building a plot. And then, on top of that, adding a plot title is done differently when the plot has facets.\nAll of this requires to memorise different commands for different use cases. And it’s a big slow down for me. So I relate to the example given above and I would also recommend plotnine. My only gripe is that is updated on a different schedule than R’s ggplot2 and both can be sometimes out of sync. It only happened to me once though that something that I knew was possible in ggplot2 was not in plotnine."
