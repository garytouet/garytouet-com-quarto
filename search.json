I’ve worked with international companies in digital transformation like Henkel and Sodexo, and a pure-player scale-up like Zalando.\nProven ability to navigate complexity: I’ve mitigated risks in high-stakes product launches (millions of euros at risk), worked on cross-market features with millions of users, uncovered insights from terabytes of user behavior data.\nCustomer-focused and methodical: I bring battled-tested approaches developed during high-growth years at Zalando. I contributed to Zalando’s group data strategy and produced several documents who made their way into the company’s product development best practices.\nHands-on leadership: I can lead teams and projects, but I’m also happy to roll up my sleeves and execute when needed. I keep my coding skills fresh (SQL, Python, R) so I can automate and analyse on my own.\nSolo freelancer: more affordable than consulting firms and we will build a more personal collaboration."

    "text": "Saving in various sizes and formats\nThis is when things get more complicated for two reasons:\n\nNo clear spec for favicons exists. It depends on browsers, mobile OSes. Different formats, different sizes.\nResizing a plot is not as straightforward as I thought\n\n\nFavicon specs\nWhile browsing, I found various specs1 for this favicon. I will spare you the details. In the end, I landed on the following:\n\nfavicon.ico 32x32 (px)\nfavicon.png 96x96 (px)\napple-touch-icon.png 180x180 (px)\nfavicon.svg\n\n\n\nScaling issues\nSo far, I’ve set all my measurements in inches (figure size, font size). Now, my goal is to provide a size in pixels and to automatically resize and scale the icon accordingly.\nThe problem is…\n\nggsave(\n  p,\n  filename = \"icons/favicon_problem.png\",\n  dpi = 'retina', #retina = 320, according to documentation\n  width = 96,\n  height = 96,\n  units = 'px'\n)\n\n\n… that the dimensions are good, but the proportions are not. With ggsave I can easily define the size in pixels, but this doesn’t change the font size in the plot.\nChristophe Nicault’s article Understanding text size and resolution in ggplot2 explains very well what happens. They recommend to use a package called ragg and the scaling option.\nI tried, but simply installing ragg created a big error2 in Quarto and completely destroyed my ability to preview my post. I also played around with the scale option in ggsave(), to no avail.\nAs a result, I decided to handle the scaling myself.\n\n\nDIY scaling\nSince I’ve defined sizes in inches when creating the graphic and since I want to express icon dimensions in pixels, I need to understand the relationship between inches and pixels first.\nFrom Understanding text size and resolution in ggplot2:\n\nThe relation is : (size in inches) = (screen size in pixel) / PPI or (screen size in pixel) = DPI * (size in inches)\n\nIn other words, if I want an icon with size 32 x 32 pixels, the conversion in inches will be 32 / 320 = 0.1 (with a resolution of 320). I can create a function that takes these two parameters as arguments, converts that to a measurement in inches and then passes that to ggplot2.\n\n# Function that creates the icon with sizes in inches\ncreate_icon &lt;- function(square_size_inches) {\n  p &lt;- ggplot() +\n    geom_tile(\n      aes(\n        x = 0,\n        y = 0,\n        width = square_size_inches,\n        height = square_size_inches\n      ),\n      fill = my_blue\n    ) +\n    geom_text(\n      aes(\n        x = 0,\n        y = -square_size_inches / 5,\n        label = \"GT\",\n        family = \"Inter\",\n        fontface = \"bold\"\n      ),\n      color = \"white\",\n      size = square_size_inches /2,\n      size.unit = 'in'\n    ) +\n    theme_void()\n\n    return(p)\n  }\n\n# Function that uses a size in pixels and a dpi to convert it into inches, create the icon and save it to disk\ncreate_and_save_icon &lt;- function(filename, size_pixels, dpi = 320) {\n  square_size_inches &lt;- size_pixels / dpi\n  icon &lt;- create_icon(square_size_inches)\n\n  ggsave(\n    plot = icon,\n    filename = filename,\n    dpi = dpi,\n    width = size_pixels,\n    height = size_pixels,\n    units = 'px',\n    bg = my_blue #otherwise white outline in png\n  )\n}\n\nLet’s try it out!\n\ncreate_and_save_icon(filename = 'icons/favicon_32x32.png', size_pixels = 32, dpi = 320)\n\n\nIt works! I can now generate the different sizes that I need.\n\nsizes = c(32, 96, 180)\n\nfor (size in sizes) {\n  filename = paste0('icons/favicon_', size, 'x', size, '.png')\n\n  create_and_save_icon(filename = filename, size_pixels = size, dpi = 320)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfavicon_32x32.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfavicon_96x96.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfavicon_180x180.png\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for the last one, the .svg version. Here, we’ll use the base R built-in SVG graphics device:\n\nicon &lt;- create_icon(1)\nsvg(\"icons/favicon.svg\", width = 1, height = 1)\nprint(icon)\ninvisible(dev.off())\n\n\n\n\nfavicon.svg"
