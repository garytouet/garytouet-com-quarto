    "text": "Creating the graphic\nI decided to tackle the blue background first. I remembered that ggplot has different geoms to create a square. I looked up the documentation and started coding.\nI iterated through geom_raster(), geom_rect() and landed on geom_tile(). It is best suited for my use case. I just need to define the size of the square and use the origin (0,0) as the center of the square.\n\nsquare_size &lt;- 5\nmy_blue &lt;- \"#0063dc\"\n\n(p &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_tile(\n    aes(x = 0, y = 0, width = square_size, height = square_size),\n    fill = my_blue\n  ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, I will 1) add the text, position it, and then 2) remove all plot elements like grid lines, axes, etc.\n\n(p &lt;- p +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(\n      x = 0,\n      y = -square_size / 5,\n      label = \"GT\",\n      family = \"Inter\",\n      fontface = \"bold\"\n    ),\n    color = \"white\",\n    size = square_size / 2,\n    size.unit = 'in'\n  ) +\n  theme_void()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoilà!\nOn purpose, I defined the position of the text and its size as a factor of the variable square_size. I hope that it will make it easier to export this graphic in different sizes after.\nRegarding the font, I’m using Inter. I had to download and install it on Mac OS for it to become available in the plot."

    "title": "Creating the favicon for this website with ggplot2",
    "section": "Saving in various sizes and formats",
    "text": "Saving in various sizes and formats\nThis is when things get more complicated for two reasons:\n\nNo clear spec for favicons exists. It depends on browsers, mobile OSes. Different formats, different sizes.\nResizing a plot is not as straightforward as I thought\n\n\nFavicon specs\nWhile browsing, I found various specs1 for this favicon. I will spare you the details. In the end, I landed on the following:\n\nfavicon.ico 32x32 (px)\nfavicon.png 96x96 (px)\napple-touch-icon.png 180x180 (px)\nfavicon.svg\n\n\n\nScaling issues\nSo far, I’ve set all my measurements in inches (figure size, font size). Now, my goal is to provide a size in pixels and to automatically resize and scale the icon accordingly.\nThe problem is…\n\nggsave(\n  p,\n  filename = \"icons/favicon_problem.png\",\n  dpi = 'retina', #retina = 320, according to documentation\n  width = 96,\n  height = 96,\n  units = 'px'\n)\n\n\n… that the dimensions are good, but the proportions are not. With ggsave I can easily define the size in pixels, but this doesn’t change the font size in the plot.\nChristophe Nicault’s article Understanding text size and resolution in ggplot2 explains very well what happens. They recommend to use a package called ragg and the scaling option.\nI tried, but simply installing ragg created a big error2 in Quarto and completely destroyed my ability to preview my post. I also played around with the scale option in ggsave(), to no avail.\nAs a result, I decided to handle the scaling myself.\n\n\nDIY scaling\nSince I’ve defined sizes in inches when creating the graphic and since I want to express icon dimensions in pixels, I need to understand the relationship between inches and pixels first.\nFrom Understanding text size and resolution in ggplot2:\n\nThe relation is : (size in inches) = (screen size in pixel) / PPI or (screen size in pixel) = DPI * (size in inches)\n\nIn other words, if I want an icon with size 32 x 32 pixels, the conversion in inches will be 32 / 320 = 0.1 (with a resolution of 320). I can create a function that takes these two parameters as arguments, converts that to a measurement in inches and then passes that to ggplot2.\n\n# Function that creates the icon with sizes in inches\ncreate_icon &lt;- function(square_size_inches) {\n  p &lt;- ggplot() +\n    geom_tile(\n      aes(\n        x = 0,\n        y = 0,\n        width = square_size_inches,\n        height = square_size_inches\n      ),\n      fill = my_blue\n    ) +\n    geom_text(\n      aes(\n        x = 0,\n        y = -square_size_inches / 5,\n        label = \"GT\",\n        family = \"Inter\",\n        fontface = \"bold\"\n      ),\n      color = \"white\",\n      size = square_size_inches /2,\n      size.unit = 'in'\n    ) +\n    theme_void()\n\n    return(p)\n  }\n\n# Function that uses a size in pixels and a dpi to convert it into inches, create the icon and save it to disk\ncreate_and_save_icon &lt;- function(filename, size_pixels, dpi = 320) {\n  square_size_inches &lt;- size_pixels / dpi\n  icon &lt;- create_icon(square_size_inches)\n\n  ggsave(\n    plot = icon,\n    filename = filename,\n    dpi = dpi,\n    width = size_pixels,\n    height = size_pixels,\n    units = 'px',\n    bg = my_blue #otherwise white outline in png\n  )\n}\n\nLet’s try it out!\n\ncreate_and_save_icon(filename = 'icons/favicon_32x32.png', size_pixels = 32, dpi = 320)\n\n\nIt works! I can now generate the different sizes that I need.\n\nsizes = c(32, 96, 180)\n\nfor (size in sizes) {\n  filename = paste0('icons/favicon_', size, 'x', size, '.png')\n\n  create_and_save_icon(filename = filename, size_pixels = size, dpi = 320)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfavicon_32x32.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfavicon_96x96.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfavicon_180x180.png\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd for the last one, the .svg version. Here, we’ll use the base R built-in SVG graphics device:\n\nicon &lt;- create_icon(1)\nsvg(\"icons/favicon.svg\", width = 1, height = 1)\nprint(icon)\ninvisible(dev.off())\n\n\n\n\nfavicon.svg"

I’ve worked with international companies in digital transformation like Henkel and Sodexo, and a pure-player scale-up like Zalando.\nProven ability to navigate complexity: I’ve mitigated risks in high-stakes product launches (millions of euros at risk), worked on cross-market features with millions of users, uncovered insights from terabytes of user behavior data.\nCustomer-focused and methodical: I bring battled-tested approaches developed during high-growth years at Zalando. I contributed to Zalando’s group data strategy and produced several documents who made their way into the company’s product development best practices.\nHands-on leadership: I can lead teams and projects, but I’m also happy to roll up my sleeves and execute when needed. I keep my coding skills fresh (SQL, Python, R) so I can automate and analyse on my own.\nSolo freelancer: more affordable than consulting firms and we will build a more personal collaboration."

    "text": "Anil Dash (emphasis is his):\n\nMost people who actually have technical roles within the tech industry, like engineers, product managers, and others who actually make the technologies we all use, are fluent in the latest technologies like LLMs. They aren’t the big, loud billionaires that usually get treated as the spokespeople for all of tech.\nAnd what they all share is an extraordinary degree of consistency in their feelings about AI, which can be pretty succinctly summed up:\nTechnologies like LLMs have utility, but the absurd way they’ve been over-hyped, the fact they’re being forced on everyone, and the insistence on ignoring the many valid critiques about them make it very difficult to focus on legitimate uses where they might add value.\n\nDefinitely agree with him. It was refreshing to read.\nThese days, I spend more time than usual on LinkedIn and I follow the Tech news more consistently. I often question my own judgment and my own sanity while reading.\nThe amount of blind embrace for this technology in the mainstream’s discourse is astounding in my opinion. I’m looking forward to the next stage of the hype cycle, when reality sets in and expectations lower, to have more interesting discussions."
