I’ve worked with international companies in digital transformation like Henkel and Sodexo, and a pure-player scale-up like Zalando.\n1. Proven ability to navigate complexity: I’ve mitigated risks in high-stakes product launches (millions of euros at risk), worked on cross-market features with millions of users, uncovered insights from terabytes of user behavior data.\n1. Customer-focused and methodical: I bring battled-tested approaches developed during high-growth years at Zalando. I contributed to Zalando’s group data strategy and produced several documents who made their way into the company’s product development best practices.\n1. Hands-on leadership: I can lead teams and projects, but I’m also happy to roll up my sleeves and execute when needed. I keep my coding skills fresh (SQL, Python, R) so I can automate and analyse on my own.\n1. Solo freelancer: more affordable than consulting firms and we will build a more personal collaboration.\n\n## What clients say about me\n\n::: {#testimonials}\n:::\n\nMore references [available](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garytouet/details/recommendations/) on LinkedIn.\n\n## Want to work with me?\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"mailto:garytouet@icloud.com\" role=\"button\">Email me</a>\n\nFeel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garytouet/) or [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@garytouet) too.",
