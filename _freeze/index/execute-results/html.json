In other words, I’m an analyst with product development experience or a product manager with strong analytical skills.\n\nI can lead projects or teams to deliver work that moves the needle. I can also directly contribute thanks to years of experience as a product analyst:\n\n- find patterns and insights in millions of records of customer behaviour data,\n- prepare and visualise data using SQL, R or Python,\n- launch, monitor and analyse a/b tests,\n- equip teams with KPIs, dashboards and curated datasets.\n\nI am comfortable working as a bridge between business leaders and technical teams. I can translate business questions into data problems and data insights back into business decisions.\n\nThe bulk of my experience deals with extracting insights from quantitative data sources. Nonetheless, I also have experience with qualitative data. I have carried-out small scale user interviews and usability tests for products I managed as well as survey analyses.\n\nI acquired this breadth of skills mostly during my 8-year tenure at Zalando (European e-commerce scale-up). I got to grow alongside a company that was scaling from startup energy to enterprise sophistication. Most notably, I was part of the first cohort of product analysts in the company. I had the chance to work in teams at different stages of the product development process, always building the customer-facing web and app experiences. I ended writing documents that establish best practices for analytics during product development, I participated in the creation of the group’s data strategy and I later guided others into growing into these roles as a team lead.\n\nFinally, I feel very comfortable in international environments. I find it easier to work in English than in my native French. I am also at-ease working in multidisciplinary teams (designers, engineers, product managers, etc.)\n\n### Working with me\n\nMy approach is heavily influenced by Amazon's working backwards model: start with what you're trying to achieve, then figure out how to get there.\n\nI bring a calm and organised approach to projects. I believe in finishing what we started first and in having transparent prioritisation mechanisms to keep things manageable. In addition, I approach ambiguity with serenity. Data combined with product management methods are great to reduce uncertainty and gain clarity.\n\nI am open to feedback and I take it to heart to improve whenever given the chance.\n\nI am used to cultures where we surface and discuss problems in an honest and dispassionate manner. I strive to leave my ego out of the equation and focus on what's best for the company.\n\nExperience has taught me to be realistic about what data can and cannot do. I focus on insights that can actually influence decisions. I prefer to work in iterations. Incremental improvements beat grand plans that never ship.\n\nI'm comfortable working in large corporate environments and understand how to navigate complex organizational structures effectively. Whether it's a fast-growing scale-up or a digital transformation initiative within a traditional company, I know how to work within existing processes while getting things done.\n\n### What I can do for you\n\n_Strategic leadership:_\n\n- Product management for your data projects\n- Lead or principal product analyst roles\n- Help develop analytics practices within your product organisation\n- Accompany you in generating actionable insights from customer behaviour data\n\n_Hands-on support:_\n\n- Exploratory data analysis and insight generation\n- KPI definition and reporting frameworks\n- A/B testing and experimentation programs\n- ETL, automation, and data pipeline work\n\nWhile most of my experience comes from e-commerce, I'm interested in working with all types of online services, websites, and apps. Good analytics principles translate across industries.\n\n### Contact\n\nWhether you're looking for help with a specific project or just want to chat about analytics/product management, feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garytouet/), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@garytouet), or [email](mailto:hello@garytouet.com).\n\n\n## Testimonials\n\nQuotes from my most recent clients and former employer.\n\n::: {#testimonials}\n:::\n\nMore references [available](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garytouet/details/recommendations/) on LinkedIn.\n\n## Latest posts\n\n::: {#latest-posts}\n:::\n",
